**Week 6** was Catch-Up/Project Week. I chose to use this as a catch-up week and pair-programmed quite a bit, which helped with reinforcing some more recent topics. The main goal was to make sure I was very comfortable with CodeIgniter, as I knew the Red Belt exam would be on this.

So this week I worked on a couple of older assignments that were still floating around.
I also spent a lot of time working on a book review website, which functions but is not very nice looking. I plan on putting some more work into it and including it (and a couple of other projects) as part of my portfolio.

On Friday, we took the Red Belt exam. It lasted 4.5 hours and required us to build a friend-adding website in CodeIgniter. I got stressed out with my MySQL queries by the end, but I finished. I got my score this morning (Monday) and I passed!

Onto Week 7 and more Javascript!
