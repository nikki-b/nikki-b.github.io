Halfway through the program and we're back to Javascript! We started **Week 7** with going back to the fundamentals of JS - running through some basic algorithms and assignments, like the one below...

This and some other code below generate some output...

Later, I forked a project on GitHub and worked on some crazy circle generation...

And I made a ninja walk around via key commands, created dynamic circles with collision effects, and messed around with [Street Fighter](http://nikki-b.github.io/street_fighter/).

I had a lot of fun doing all of these assignments, and am very interested in doing more with Javascript (and possibly making a browser-based game!)

At the end of the week, we started on Node.js. Node.js can be used to build a web-server with Javascript - and it has some awesome features (some of which I will show next week!)

Week eight is all about the MEAN stack and I will be able to share some fun assignments!
