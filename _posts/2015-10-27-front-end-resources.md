Every web developer, regardless of technology or front- vs back-end, needs to care about the user's experience with their app. People will not use something if it is confusing, ugly, or flat-out doesn't work as it should. It absolutely behooves any developer to put at least some effort into thinking about how a user will interact with their work. We don't just make things for ourselves, right? (Maybe sometimes - but you gotta make a living somehow.)

I recently shared some of these resources with students, and I figure this will also be a good home for them. I'll likely update it whenever I come across something cool and useful.
