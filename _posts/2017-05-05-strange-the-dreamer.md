When was the last time you read something that made you feel <em>wonder</em>?

Lazlo Strange is an orphan, librarian, and a dreamer with a love for fantasy. His favorite story is that of the lost city of Weep - what happened to the city and its inhabitants? What happened to its magic? Lazlo fights for his dream of Weep and discovers much more than he ever imagined could exist.

I haven't read Laini Taylor's popular <em>Daughter of Smoke and Bone</em> trilogy but heard enough raving to know <em>Strange the Dreamer</em> would be a good bet. It ended up being one of my favorite reads so far this year, and maybe the last couple years.

Admittedly, I don't read many books with male protagonists, but Lazlo was easy to relate to and love. He's obsessed with fairy tales and is just a good person. I worried he would become boring and predictable, but the journey Taylor takes him on allows for believable character development along with a fantastical plot. Myths and legends come to life around the characters, but human nature remains the same - Taylor pulls apart her characters and examines the good and bad inside all of them.

The world building in <em>Strange</em> is amazing - Taylor's writing is poetic, and I felt Lazlo's awe and excitement throughout the entire book. There were a couple of characters and plot lines that fell to the wayside by the end of the book, but I'm excited to see where they lead in the sequel (<em>The Muse of Nightmares</em>, 2018). I did not see the ending coming for this one and feel a bit emotionally devastated after it! I can't wait to see what Taylor takes Lazlo next.

This was an incredible, unique, and emotional read. Easily a 5/5 rating.
