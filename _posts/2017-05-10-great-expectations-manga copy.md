Remember using CliffNotes or SparkNotes in high school? Sometimes for books you hadn’t read? (I know I wasn’t the only one. Sorry, The Iliad.)

Imagining what my book report would have looked like if I had used this adaptation as my source for Great Expectations (I did read that one, though) is kinda hilarious. This manga is entertaining and a good way to review the novel in a quickly digestible format, but only if you have some idea of the plot beforehand.

It’s been about twelve years since I read GE so I only have brief impressions left of it now. I know that the plot is cray… Miss Havisham wears an old wedding dress… an
d Pip is in love with Estella for God knows why. According to the manga, I remembered it correctly. But it also helped me to remember other important plot points – so, hey, success! The story is all over the place, but so is the source, so I commend Stacy King for keeping all of the storylines together.

Like with Pride and Prejudice, I enjoyed the art for the most part. It’s not particularly memorable… In fact, the only parts I remember are the not-so-great panels combined with awkward writing. (See right.) Miss Havisham looked a little too similar to a Sailor Moon villain at times.

Manga Classics: Great Expectations is a good review and teaching tool, especially when trying to make the classics accessible to different audiences.
