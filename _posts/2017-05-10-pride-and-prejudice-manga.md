Manga Classics from Udon Entertainment released six classic novel adaptations a few years ago in the attempt to reach younger audiences. The adaptations are mostly faithful to the source material and have prepared lesson plans available online for educators. It’s one of the most earnest attempts at reaching younger, modern audiences and it seems they’ve been successful with this.

I’m a sucker for any and every Jane Austen adaptation. I’ve watched Pride & Prejudice & Zombies four times (though, to be fair, it’s actually a very entertaining movie and well done for what it is.) And I’ll read or watch anything attached to “regency.” A manga Austen adaptation is directly up my alley.

That said, I’m an adult and far out of high school English class. I have no idea what Common Core is or what “the kids” are reading these days. But I love Jane Austen and I love manga/anime, so why not? I received Pride and Prejudice from NetGalley, but had previously picked up the Emma adaptation from the library and enjoyed that so was eager to read this one.

The art is very adorable and typical for shoujo manga (manga that is aimed at a young, female audience and typically has a lot of romance and ~swooning~.) At times, it’s maybe too dramatic – there’s a moment when Elizabeth is pining after Mr. Darcy and wraps herself in window curtains while crying. That may be “out there” for Austen, but it’s a very manga moment. With this book and Emma, I really enjoy the artist’s detail for the hair, fashions, and flowers. Every page has something to hold your attention.

As expected, some characters are exaggerated for comical effect, Mr. Collins maybe too much so. I mean… what is his face?? (See picture above.) And he hides in a teapot to propose to Elizabeth. It’s funny and I love it – but doesn’t fit with a faithful representation of his character.

One character that just screamed for the manga treatment is Mrs. Bennet. I have no other words aside from this picture.

This was a fun, quick read. I would recommend it to fans of Austen, or anyone who hasn’t read her work and just wants the quick and dirty version.
