Vengeance Road is a YA Western novel telling the story of Kate, a teen girl hellbent on making her father’s murderers pay for their crimes. Along the way, she uncovers family secrets, makes friends, and learns how far she’s willing to let her anger take her.

> When I were first learning to shoot a rifle, Pa told me that nearly every battle people face is in their heads. If you think you can’t do something, you won’t. If you believe you can, it’s only a matter of time before you will.

I first read this book about two years ago. I picked it up at the library after falling in love with the cover. It was so different from anything else I had read, and I instantly fell in love with the characters.

I reread this in May prior to reading the companion novel, Retribution Rails (November 2017 release). Since I’d just started listening to audiobooks, I decided to try out the audiobook for this. Even though Erin Bowman writes the characters with authentic accents, I realized that I’m not great at imagining them. (Makes sense – I’m terrible at accents!) The audiobook was much more immersive, and I really enjoyed it.

Vengeance Road does hit one of my major pain points, though. Dang ol’ traveling and camping descriptions. Conversations around a firepit just don’t do it for me, and I found those areas of the book challenging to get through.

Despite a few challenges, VR is an exciting cowboy story about revenge and acceptance. Kate is a gruff and prickly badass, but Bowman doesn’t shy away from digging into her grief and loneliness. It’s an entertaining read and thoroughly unique.
