Retribution Rails is a really fun ride. (ðŸ¤“) It follows Reece, a member of the Rose Riders gang seeking redemption and freedom, and Charlotte, an aspiring journalist dreaming of her own freedom.

When I saw a Retribution Rails ARC on Instagram, I freaked. I loved [Vengeance Road]({{ site.url }}/articles/2017-08/vengeance-road) when I read it in 2015, and was so excited to see a companion novel coming soon. Soon as inâ€¦ November 2017. Yikes. So, I requested my first ARC and was surprised to get an email with instructions to download the eARC. And now Iâ€™m deep in ARC-heaven/hellâ€¦.

I loved the alternating POVs between Charlotte and Reece, and how perfectly the story from Vengeance Road was continued and woven in. (Mild spoiler â€“ yes, characters from VR reappear!) Retribution Rails more conflicts and twists with a satisfying conclusion.

My only complaint (no camping this time â€“ whew!) is that there is maybe too much time spent inside of the characterâ€™s heads. I get that Reece feels guilty and Charlotte is mad about everything â€“ they sure think about it a lot.

Once again, Erin Bowman wrote a Western novel that is relatable and exciting. I fell in love with new and old characters, and have a weird urge to ride a train around the country now.
