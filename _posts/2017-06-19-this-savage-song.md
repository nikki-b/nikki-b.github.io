When I first picked up This Savage Song, I was a bit unsure of the concept. A monster that can steal souls using a song? But given my love for VE/Victoria Schwab and, well, anything with monsters... figured I needed to just get to it! And the cover is <em>gorgeous.</em> (I'm a sucker for pretty letters!)</span>

So the thing is - Schwab is a total master at character studies. She also creates the <em>best</em> villains. (Read the <em>Shades of Magic</em> trilogy and then try to convince me otherwise.) <em>This Savage Song</em> examines bad vs good and revels in the gray area between them. It's hard to say, for most of the book, who exactly is the bad guy and why we should think so. Some readers are turned off by this, but I find it to be a compelling way of storytelling that means I'm usually unable to predict the story. What's worse than a super-predictable book??

That said, I read this one coming off of <em>A Conjuring of Light</em>, and it was a very big style switch. This Savage Song is very much a YA novel and it reads that way, albeit as a high-quality one. But Schwab's writing in her adult-level fantasy novels is an awesome monster of its own. (New rule: no puns in reviews.) My original rating for TSS was a 4/5. I was a little let down by the lessened complexity but I think that was unfair. After discussing the novel with my local book club and ruminating on my favorite character (LEO LEO LEO LEO), I raised my rating.

The main characters are Kate and August. Kate is a bit harsh (some might say unlikable), but I appreciate that because we never see that kind of female character in YA. Not everyone is a sweet and friendly Lara Jean, especially when they've grown up with a mob boss dad.
August, meanwhile, <em>is</em> sweet, which contradicts the fact that he is a "monster." And clutch your pearls because there is NO romance in this book. *clap emoji x forever* As much as I love a good romance, it's so refreshing to not have it. It's not a requirement, people!

Well, I loved this book and its unique world. I love that Schwab doesn't lecture the reader on why there are monsters or the history of this odd post-USA land. She drops you into the lives of two contrasting characters and lets you watch them clash.

And now I'll go back to devouring the recently released sequel (and duology finale), <em>Our Dark Duet</em>.
