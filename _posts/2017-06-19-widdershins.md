Amazon recommends some interesting things to me from time to time. Usually of the bear shapeshifter variety, and I have to say “Amazon, I looked at that as a joke PLS STOP.” But Widdershins is actually right up my alley so great job, Algorithm!

Widdershins is a paranormal/historical romance, which is not something I would have reached for previously, but now I know better. (Once again, good job, A.) This novel has a sweet, non-annoying, and interesting romance. Both of the main characters are well-developed and have compelling backstories revealed bit-by-bit. The main character (and the sole POV), Whyborne, is an introverted linguist at a museum who prefers to go unnoticed and undisturbed. Then Griffin comes into his office and thoroughly messes up his life, and Whyborne is very into it.

The plot is fun and creepy – the guys get into trouble with a Lovecraftian cult – but it’s not scary, and it’s actually got a few good twists. There’s quite a bit of time spent discussing the taboo nature of Griffin and Whyborne’s relationship, which leads to some additional drama. Widdershins is a quick, entertaining read, and I look forward to reading more of the duo’s adventures!

Lastly, Whyborne’s co-worker/BFF Christine is my new role model.
