I think if I had read this book, instead of listened, I might not have liked it so much. The audiobook narrator is great (I listen at 2x because I am off my rocker) and the style of writing fit that format well.

There were a number of moments where I thought "what the hell?" re: excessive metaphors but I like taking those and puzzling them out to figure out what they mean in the context of the story, so I'm not as bothered as other reviewers.

It looks like I missed out on footnotes. I think those might have been read in the audiobook, but I'm not sure. At times the reading seemed to go off on tangents, and I wouldn't be surprised if those were the footnote moments. The writing was quick, unique, and funny - sometimes a bit over the top, but I enjoyed it nonetheless.

I liked Mia and her shadow powers/kitty. I liked the gruesome "lessons" and weird assassin school. The first third of the book was a bit slow and confusing, but I loved the rest despite zoning out a bit at the end and forgetting what was happening. There's romance, but not too much, and the side characters are distinct and interesting. I love Tric with my whole Grinch-esque heart.

It's not my fave, but I enjoy Mia's "I don't give a FUCK" attitude enough that I will most definitely be listening to the next one!
