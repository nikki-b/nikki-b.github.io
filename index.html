<p><b>I'm a maker</b> - a creative support pro and occasional web developer with an eye for design and a passion for solving problems. Overall, I'm an <b>adaptable generalist</b> and will learn and use the tools needed to solve the problem I'm working on. I'm all about about expanding skills and tackling new challenges!</p>

<p>I studied History in college and worked in the insurance industry for four years afterwards. Then I took a big leap and delved into web development full-time, something that had previously been a hobby for me... back to my first GeoCities site in junior high! (It was an extremely rad Harry Potter fansite.) But I missed having a direct connection with customers, so I'm now looking for a nice balance of support and tech.</p>

<p>In my free time, I keep making things - I love to knit, play video games, bake huge cakes, and read a large number of books..</p>

<p>I live in the beautiful Pacific Northwest (WA, to be specific) with my favorites: a person, a dog, and a cat.</p>
